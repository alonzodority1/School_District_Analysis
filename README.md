# School_District_Analysis
School and Grade Data Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The school board has noticed that the reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders and Maria asked me to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once Iâ€™ve had replaced the math and reading scores, Maria wanted me to repeat the school district analysis and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

## Results of Excluding the Thomas High School 9th graders math and reading results

### How is the district summary affected?
Very little affect (only a few 100ths of a percent) on the district average however passing math% went from 74.98 to 74.76, passing reading % from 85.81 to 85.66 and overall passing % from 65.17 to 64.86   

### How is the school summary affected?
Obviously the per school summary impact was limited to the row pertaining to Thomas High School: Average Math and Reading scores went from 83.42 and 83.85 to 83.35 and 83.9 respecitvely while math, reading and overall passing % went from 93.27 / 97.31 / 90.95 to 93.19 / 97.02 / 90.63 respectively.

This slight drop in overall passing percentage did not alter Thomas High School's ranking as the 2nd highest in the district

### How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
Math and reading scores by grade: Aggregate average score by grade was not requested as part of the analysis thus omitting THS' 9th grade scores have little effect on report.
Scores by school spending: The $630 -644 Spending bucket saw slight changes (a few 100ths of a percent) across the indicators as result of the recalcutaion, largest varation being a .08 decrease in overall passing  
Scores by school size: Similarly the Medium Size catagory saw a few 100ths of a percent change in output, the largest variation being a .07% decrease in overall passing 
Scores by school type: Following the pattern Charter School saw only a slight adjustment, the largest being a .03% in overall passing.

## Summary

While omitting THS 9th grader results in both math and reading did alter the final out puts of average Math and Reading scores as well Math, Reading and Overall Passing % the omission had very low impact on the school's ranking and even less impact on disctrit results based on spending, size or type.
