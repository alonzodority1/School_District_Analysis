### Purpose
The school board has noticed that the reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders and Maria asked me to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once I’ve had replaced the math and reading scores, Maria wanted me to repeat the school district analysis and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

## Election-Audit Summary
This script can be incredibly useful in the audits of future elections.  It is designed to be able to handle large amonuts of data points.  With small modifications in the intake of candidate names and output format it can easily be used to for:
1. An entire state's congressional election
2. Govenoral elections

With a few more additonal fields it can even be used to measure polling.
